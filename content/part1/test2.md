| **Vibe**          | "The Easy Button."                                                                  | "The Professional Framework."                                                        |
| **Effort**        | Low. Set it up once, click "Publish" in the plugin.                                 | Medium. Requires some Terminal/Git knowledge.                                        |
| **Canvas**        | **Weak.** Doesn't natively render Canvas well; often just shows a link or an image. | **Stronger.** Can embed the HTML files produced by the _Webpage HTML Export_ plugin. |
| **Customization** | Limited to Obsidian themes.                                                         | Infinite. It's basically its own website engine.                                     |
